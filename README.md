## Introduction
The samples repository has now evolved into samples-java and samples-kotlin. Each repository consists of a copy of the existing CorDapp samples in the respective programming language. We have also reorganized our samples into different categories:

* Advanced: In these samples, we demonstrate more complex and sophisticated features of Corda. ([Java Version](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/tree/master/Advanced), [Kotlin Version](https://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin/tree/master/Advanced))

* Basic: They demonstrate fundamental and useful techniques for CorDapp development. ([Java Version](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/tree/master/Basic), [Kotlin Version](https://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin/tree/master/Basic))

* Feature: These samples demonstrate specific Corda functionalities. ([Java Version](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/tree/master/Features), [Kotlin Version](https://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin/tree/master/Features))

* Tokens: These include TokenSDK related samples. Learn more at [TokenSDK](https://github.com/corda/token-sdk). ([Java Version](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/tree/master/Tokens), [Kotlin Version](https://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin/tree/master/Tokens))
